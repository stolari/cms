	<p class="text-grey">"It is possible to change your course location up to 7 days before the event. In order to do this, please visit ‘My Account’, find the 
	course that you would like to change and press ‘EDIT COURSE’ - then follow the instructions. Please be aware that not all of our courses are 
	offered in every location."</p>	
	
	<h3><b>I lost my ticket, can I get a new one?</b></h3>

	<h3><b>The course I want to attend is sold out, can I sign up for a waiting list?</b></h3>
	<p class="text-grey">"At the moment it is not possible to sign up for a waiting list. However, if a participant cancels a ticket to a sold out course, the ticket 
	will be re-listed on our website and made available for purchase up until 7 days before the course date."</p>
	
	<h3><b>Which barbecues do you use for the courses?</b></h3>
	<p class="text-grey">Most of our courses use both charcoal and gas barbecues - some of the locations also have electric barbecues available for you to use. 
	You are always more than welcome to enquire as to whether a specific barbecue will be used at the course that you will be attending. You will 
	find more information regarding all of our courses on the Course Overview site.</p>	
	
	<h3><b>Will the course be inside or outside?</b></h3>
	<p class="text-grey">"In almost all of our locations you will prepare the food inside and barbecue it outside. But this depends on the location and the specific course. 
	Specific information regarding this can be found on the Location Detail site."</p>
			
	<h3><b>How old should a participant be in order to attend a course at the Weber Grill Academy?</b></h3>
	<p class="text-grey">Course participants must be at least 16 years old. This is sometimes adjusted for a particular course and it will be stated in the 
	course description 	(e.g., a children’s course).</p>
		
	<h3><b>What should I bring when attending a course? </b></h3>
	<p class="text-grey">If you have used a gift voucher to pay for the course, please bring the voucher with you. Otherwise, just bring your ticket. You will receive an apron 
	(which you can take home with you) when you arrive at the course, but depending on the weather and which location you are visiting, please wear proper outdoor 
	clothes. All of the barbecues, accessories, food and beverages will be provided by the Weber Grill Academy, so you do not have to bring these.</p>	
	
	<h3><b>I have an allergy. Who should I inform?</b></h3>
	<p class="text-grey">"Please inform the specific Weber Grill Academy location that you will be attending if you have an allergy so that it is possible for them to take this 
	into account during their planning. Please do so at least one week before attending your course."</p>	
	
	<h3><b>Can I buy Weber products after attending a course at the Weber Grill Academy?</b></h3>
	<p class="text-grey">"If you have attended a course at a Weber Grill Academy location that is placed within a Weber Original Store, it is possible to purchase any of the store’s 
	products after the course. Sadly, this is not possible at the remaining Weber Grill Academy locations as they have no store in context. 
	However, you are always more than welcome to visit our webshop or one of our many Weber dealers."</p>	
	
	<h3><b>I forgot my jacket/apron/recipe booklet etc. at a course. Who should I contact?</b></h3>
	<p class="text-grey">Please contact the specific Weber Grill Academy location where you attended the course.</p>	

	<h3><b>Can I buy a gift voucher for a course?</b></h3>
	<p class="text-grey">"It is possible to buy an open gift voucher for a determined amount, but not for a specific course. 
	The receiver can use this gift voucher to pay for their desired course. If the gift voucher's value  
	is not enough to pay for the desired course, it is possible to pay the remaining amount with a credit card. "</p>		
	
	<h3><b>Can I return a gift voucher for a refund?</b></h3>
	<p class="text-grey">It is not possible to receive a refund for a gift voucher, but it is valid for 3 years and can be used for all available courses that are offered by 
	the Weber Grill Academy within this period.</p>
