		<h2 class="headline-2">2. Collection and use of your data</h2>
		<p class="text-grey">The nature and scope of the collection and use of your data is differentiated according to whether you are using our website only to retrieve information, e.g. to look at our offerings, or if you want to make use of our services offered there, in other words, to purchase products:</p>
		<h3 class="headline-3">a) Informational use</h3>
		<p class="text-grey">For the purely informational use of our website, you are generally not required to provide personal data. In this case we will collect and use only the data automatically transmitted by your Internet browser, e.g.:</p>

			<li>the operating system used</li>
			<li>the last web page you visited</li>
			<li>the data transmitted and the access status (file transmitted, file not found, etc.) and</li>
			<li>your IP address.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="text-grey">When you make an informational visit, we will collect and use these data only in a non-personal form. This is done to allow you to use the retrieved web pages, for statistical purposes and to improve our website offerings. We will save the IP address only for the duration of your visit; no personal analysis of the data will take place.</p>
		<h3 class="headline-3">b) Use of offers / Purchases from Weber-Stephen</h3>
		<p class="text-grey">We will collect personal data only to the extent that you provide them voluntarily to use as part of the order transaction, or when registering a Weber-ID. We will use the collected data only for processing the contract. After completion of the transaction, your data will be blocked and deleted upon expiry of the retention obligations under tax and commercial law, unless you have expressly agreed to further use of the data.</p>
		<p class="text-grey">Your data may be transmitted for the above purpose to service providers assisting us (shipping companies, payment services providers, commissioned cookery schools), whom we have of course selected with due care. In all other instances, we will disclose your data to third parties only if the law so obliges us.</p>
		<h4 class="headline-4">aa)	Registration of a Weber-ID</h4>

Furthermore, you can also conveniently log in at any time to our shop, for example to check the status of your order or to place further orders without re-registration. With a Weber-ID, you can also use the memo function or the wish list.</p>
		<p class="text-grey">As a registered user, you can also submit orders in the shop and for the Grill Academy using your Weber-ID.</p>
		<p class="text-grey">In addition, the Weber-ID will be used to present registered users with a personalised and uniquely tailored experience on our website.

		<h2 class="headline-2">3. Use of cookies</h2>
		<p class="text-grey">Our website uses cookies. Cookies are small text files, which are dispatched from our web server to your browser as part of your visit to our website, and which will be retained by your browser on your computer for later retrieval.</p>
		<h4 class="headline-4">Session cookies</h4>
		<p class="text-grey">We use "session cookies" (also known as temporary cookies), in other words, cookies that are saved only temporarily during your use of one of our web pages. The objective of these cookies is to identify your computer during a visit to our website after changing from one of our web pages to another of our web pages and to be able to determine the end of your visit.<br><br>
		The cookies will be deleted as soon as you terminate your browser session.</p>
		<h4 class="headline-4">Tracking and targeting cookies</h4>
		<p class="text-grey">Our website also uses tracking and targeting cookies, which capture user behaviour. In doing so, we only use "first party cookies", meaning the cookies will not be made accessible to other domains by your browser.</p>
		<p class="text-grey">The cookies are used, among other things, for the following services:</p>
		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>Range measurement - this function records the number of times that a website is accessed</li>
			<li>Clickstream analysis - this function records the movements of a user on a web page (e.g. the route that a customer takes to reach a specific product in the shop)</li>
			<li>Ad Impressions and Click Through - this function analyses how often a given advertising banner is displayed and clicked</li>
			<li>Mouse movements and heatmaps - this function analyses and captures the mouse movements of users in areas where there is particularly high traffic ("heat mapping")</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="text-grey">You can determine if cookies will be placed through your browser settings. For example, you can disable the saving of cookies as such in your browser, or you can limit it to certain web pages, or you can configure your browser to such an extent that you will be notified automatically as soon the server seeks to place a cookie, and you will be asked to respond to this request. However, for technical reasons, session cookies must be allowed to make use of the full range of functions of our website.</p>

		<h3 class="headline-3">c. Google AdWords</h3>
		<p class="text-grey">This website uses Google AdWords, an analysis service provided by Google, and Conversion Tracking as part of Google AdWords. In doing so, if you click on an advertisement displayed by Google, Google AdWords places a cookie for Conversion Tracking on the hard driver of your computer (a "conversion cookie"). These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If you visit specific pages on our website, we and Google can detect that you have clicked on this advertisement and were directed to this page.</p>
		<p class="text-grey">The information collected by means of the conversion cookies serve to create statistics for AdWords customers who use Conversion Tracking. Through these statistics, we learn the total number of users who have clicked on the advertisement displayed by Google and have retrieved a web page equipped with a Conversion Tracking tag.</p>
		<p class="text-grey">For further information on the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy, please follow this link: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/policies/technologies/ads/">http://www.google.co.uk/policies/technologies/ads/</a>.</p>
		<h3 class="headline-3">d. Optimizely</h3>
		<p class="text-grey">Optimizely is a web analysis service provided by Optimizely Inc. With the help of Optimizely, we learn how our website is used. The service uses cookies, which transmit their data as a rule to a server located in the United States. You can prevent the saving of the data through the appropriate setting in your browser.

		<h2 class="headline-2">4. Social media plug-ins</h2>
		<p class="text-grey">Our website uses the social media plugins ("plug-ins") of the Facebook social network. These services are provided by Facebook, Inc. (the "Provider"). Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). You will find an overview of Facebook plug-ins and their appearance at:  <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>.</p>
		<p class="text-grey">For reasons of data protection, we have deliberately decided not to use direct plug-ins of social networks on our website. Instead we use the "Shariff" option. With Shariff, you can determine if and when data will be transmitted to the provider of the respective social networks. This means that when you retrieve our web pages, your data will in principle not be transmitted automatically to social networks. Only when you actively click on the respective button will your Internet browser establish a connection with the servers of the social network concerned; in other words, by clicking on the respective button (e.g. "I like"), you allow your Internet browser to establish a connection to the servers of the respective social network and to then transmit your user data to the respective provider of the social network.</p>
		<p class="text-grey">This will determine the purpose and scope of the data use and further processing and use of the data by the providers, as well as your related rights in terms of the privacy policies of the providers (Facebook: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">http://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>).</p>
		<h2 class="headline-2">5. Data security</h2>
		<p class="text-grey">All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.<br><br>
		Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.<br><br>
		We also use technical and organisational security precautions to protect any incident or collected personal data, in particular against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction, or against attacks by unauthorised persons. We continuously improve our security precautions in line with technical advances.
