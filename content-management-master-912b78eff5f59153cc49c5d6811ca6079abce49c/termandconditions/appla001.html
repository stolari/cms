<p>
Weber-Stephen Products LLC ("Weber")
End User Licence Agreement – EULA
for
the "Weber App"</p>

<h2>Object of the EULA</h2>
<p>The present conditions apply for the use of the Weber App ("App") which a user can download from the Apple or Google store and use for free. The user is requested to read the conditions and will accept these before the installation of the App onto their end device. If the user does not accept the EULA, Weber does not license the use of the App. In this respect, the user can immediately cancel the installation of the App if they do not accept the EULA.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites on the part of the customer</h2>
<p>The user has informed themselves of the functionality of the App, so that they are aware of the significant features and functions of the App and they alone are responsible for meeting these requirements. Weber does not accept responsibility for this. 
This also includes the system requirements of the App for trouble-free operation, i.e. the hardware and software environment required on the user's end. In this respect, Weber points out that the App has been developed for use with iOS and Android in the most current version. </p>
<p>The explanation of the basic functions and also the required system requirements for the usage of the App are the responsibility of the respective app store and can be viewed there by the user.  </p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p> The App is independently downloaded from the respective app store by the user and installed on their smartphone. In this respect, Weber does not provide advice or support in the installation.  </p> 
<h2> Licence </h2>
<p> Weber provides the user with a simple, unlimited time licence for the App for the usage described below. The user is entitled to download the App onto an end device and to use the App. </p>

<p>In this respect, the user is exclusively entitled to the use for their own purposes. The user is not permitted to forward the App to third parties for commercial reasons, regardless of the type and form. </p>
<p>The user may reproduce the App to the extent that this is required for it use. This also includes loading the App onto the working memory. 
The user can prepare security copies of the App for the purposes of data protection, provided all copyright notices remain unchanged and are also reproduced.</p>

<p>Changes, additions or adaptations to the App by the user are only permitted to the legal extent according to § 69 c No. 2 UrhG. Reference is made to § 69e UrhG for the decompiling of the App.</p>

<p>Where Weber provides updates or upgrades for the App, the usage conditions above apply accordingly. </p>
</p> 
<h2> Guarantee </h2>
<p> Weber is then only obligated to compensate damages to the user caused by a fault in the App where Weber has maliciously concealed the fault from the user. No additional guarantee of the material and legal nature of the App is accepted by Weber. 
 </p> 
<h2> Liability </h2>
<p> Weber is only liable for wilful intent and gross negligence according to § 521 of the German Civil Code (BGB).  </p> 
<h2> Third party rights </h2>
<p> In the creation of the App, licensed program parts and modules of third parties were processed, which are subject to their own licensing conditions. The user can view these conditions at any time on their end device in the App settings. </p> 
<h2> Other provisions </h2>
<p> In the event of legal disputes arising from this contract, the head office of Weber-Stephen Deutschland GmbH is the place of jurisdiction if (i) the user is an employer or (ii) the user has no general place of jurisdiction in the area of the Federal Republic of Germany or (iii) the user is a legal person of public law. The head office of Weber-Stephen Deutschland GmbH is currently in Ingelheim am Rhein.</p>

<p>The law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply.</p>

<p>If a provision of this EULA is or becomes ineffective, contains an inadmissible deadline or a legal loophole, the legal validity of the other provisions remains unaffected by this. Where the ineffectiveness results from an infringement against §§ 305 ff. of the German Civil Code (Validity of General Business Terms and Conditions), an effective provision will be considered to be agreed upon in place of the ineffective provision, which comes economically closest to the wishes of the parties. The same applies in the event of a legal loophole. In the event of an inadmissible deadline, the legally permissible extent shall apply. </p>
